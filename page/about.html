			<p>Welcome to the University of Manchester Science Fiction and Fantasy Society website!  </br>
			More informally known as "Warped", we meet every Monday for film screenings, quizzes, various other special events, or just in a pub to discuss science-fiction and fantasy, drink a few and sometimes play some card/board games. </br>
			We're a friendly bunch, so follow us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/warpedscifisoc">Facebook</a> and come along to meet us!</br></br>
			Our official aims:</br>
			- To bring SciFi and fantasy fans together in a friendly and welcoming environment. </br>
			- To promote cult and overlooked films, TV shows, books etc to our new members and encourage them to share their own opinions and suggestions. </br></br>
			We have a library of around 200 books that is available for use by our members. A full list of our books can be found on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20232843-warped-library">Goodreads</a>.</br>
			Make sure to join us on the <a href="http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups/warped">Student Union page</a> as well so we can put on larger and more exciting events for you all!</br></br>
			We hope to see you soon :)</p>

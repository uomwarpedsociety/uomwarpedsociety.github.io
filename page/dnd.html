    Relevant pdfs for races/backgrounds/classes will be linked below soon, as well as making up spell lists with all relevant spells for the level we'll be playing at. They'll be uploaded over the next few days. The basic rules are available <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">here</a>. These do only cover a few classes so if you want to play a cleric, fighter, rogue, or wizard, with one of the races they've listed, this is what you'll need to get started. Otherwise, I'm ok with the following - barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlock and wizard classes, and dwarf, elf, halfling, human, dragonborn, gnome, half elf and tiefling races. We are asking that everyone plays with either a good or neutral alignment, so no evil characters please! Character backgrounds will be linked soon too as they give you one or two special abilities. If anyone owns the 5e Players Handbook that would also be very useful to bring along to the session. If anyone needs help with backstories etc, <a href="http://whothefuckismydndcharacter.com">whothefuckismydndcharacter.com</a> is a great way to get some ideas!

    There are six main skills: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. We'll be using the standard array for character creation - what this means is for the six main stats, you'll assign numbers to each one. These are 15, 14, 13, 12, 10 and 8. It's best to assign numbers for the skills you'll use most often. For example, a fighter would need Strength and Constitution as their best skills, as their attacks are strength based and they'll most likely be taking more damage by being in the middle of a fight. They would not, however, need to be very clever or wise, so would have Wisdom and Intelligence as their worst skills. This example would give someone great roleplaying opportunities to play a strong moron.

    Please create level 3 characters as the first couple of levels are not the strongest (in a game of mine a wizard almost died at level 1 by falling off a table and that's not fun for you guys.) If you haven't made a character before, just make it at level 1 as that is what the rules explain the most clearly, and we'll tweak it at the beginning of the session. This is a great guide on how to fill in a sheet - You can find the 5e sheet <a href="http://zerohitpoints.com/Guides/DnD-5-Character-Creation-Checklist">online</a> - please print and use the 3pgs sheet.

    It is prefered that you fill it in the old fashioned way with a pencil so we can make any adjustments easily. If you get stuck, leave it blank and message Ellie in the discord group for help. Extra sheets will be brought to the session as well. If you're not playing a class that uses magic in any way, you can ignore the third page completely. If you would prefer to use one of the premade sheets listed online, that's also fine! There also be a few to brought on to the day, but only a limited number so please advise in advance if you would prefer one of those as they will be primarily for people who turn up on the day.

    We say this with all the love in the world - not everyone can be rogues. We would like to get as close to a balanced party as we can. Please post in the chat what you're leaning towards, we don't mind more than one of a class but any more than three and it will throw things off. There's plenty of choice!

    Just to make it extra clear - when creating a character, you choose a race, a class, and a background. You then flesh out a little bit of the character's story. Everything else is just filling in numbers!

    That's everything you guys need for now. Watch this space!

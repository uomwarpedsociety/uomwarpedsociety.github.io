<h4>Event update instructions:</h4>

<p>Opening up the EVENTS.js will present you with two arrays of events, $scope.events and $scope.pastevents. Inside these arrays you'll find blocks of code for each event which look like this:</p>

<div>
<p>{</p>
<p> date: "xx/xx/xxxx",</p>
<p> title: "EXAMPLE TITLE",</p>  
<p> description: "EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION",</p>  
<p> photo: "/image/eventphoto/EXAMPLEPHOTO.jpg",</p>  
<p> url: "https://www.facebook.com/events/EVENTIDGOESHERE/",</p>  
<p> time: "xx:xx xm",</p>  
<p> location: "EXAMPLE LOCATION",</p>  
<p>},</p>
</div>

<p>Editing each of the strings between the quotation marks will update the website accordingly in a way that should be fairly self explanatory. Simply cut and paste events from $scope.events to $scope.pastevents in order to move it to the corresponding place.</p>

<p>If you reading this it most likely means you're a new committee member for warped and this website has been passed onto you. Hopefully you can work it all out from the above instructions but if not ask in the elders facebook group for advice!</p>
